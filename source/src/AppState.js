      description: `Do you have young coders? Are you a young person interested in technology? Boise Code Camp has an all-day track of coding and technology sessions aimed at youth ages 6 to 16. In the last year, millions of kids, many of them in our own community, have learned to code with the Hour of Code and tools like Scratch and Raspberry Pi. Boise Code Camp is representative of our community and the kids in our community are starting to code.

The youth track is for the novice or experienced kid coder. In our Scratch sessions, new coders will find a very approachable platform and participants in the Hour of Code will find a very familiar interface style. Experienced coders will find challenging material for building a web site or can even sneak into an adult focused javscript or robotics session and learn what it's like to be a professional programmer. Also, what kid doesn't want to learn how to hack Minecraft and hang out with other kids who are also interested in technology?

Kid coders as young as 6 years old up through high school can present if their submission is accepted.`

We maybe didn't have all these fancy SPAs and Clouds, but we had Internet and a web browser. A few years later we would even get JavaScript and start coding pretty cool web apps and the world would never quite be the same anymore.",
